# 🔍 Windows Service Exploiter

**A Python-based scanner that identifies vulnerable Windows services with misconfigured binary permissions. This tool detects services with weak permissions allowing binary path replacement that could lead to a potential exploitation**

---

##  Features

- **Scans all services on the host**
- **Detects writable binary paths (`Everyone:(F)` / `Users:(F)`)**
- **Exports results to `vulnerable_services.csv` with timestamps**
- **Displays inline status for each service in terminal**
- **Logs to `service_exploit.log` for forensic traceability**

## Phase I: Detection
### Setup and working
1. **Windows machine (I used Windows 10 in controlled lab environment)**
2. [**Python 3.x**](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
3. **pywin32** -- `pip install pywin32`
4. **Now to create a vulnerable test service I first created a dummy executable file test.exe in `C:\Temp`**
5. `sc create TestService binPath= "C:\Temp\test.exe"`
