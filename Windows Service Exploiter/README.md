# 🔍 Windows Service Exploiter

**A Python-based scanner that identifies vulnerable Windows services with misconfigured binary permissions. This tool detects services with weak permissions allowing binary path replacement that could lead to a potential exploitation**

---

##  Features

- **Scans all services on the host**
- **Detects writable binary paths (`Everyone:(F)` / `Users:(F)`)**
- **Exports results to `vulnerable_services.csv` with timestamps**
- **Displays inline status for each service in terminal**
- **Logs to `service_exploit.log` for forensic traceability**

## Phase I: Detection
### Setup and working
1. **Windows machine (I used Windows 10 in controlled lab environment)**
2. [**Python 3.x**](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
3. **pywin32** -- `pip install pywin32`
4. **Now to create a vulnerable test service I first created a dummy executable file test.exe in `C:\Temp`**![](https://github.com/brindhasham/Lab_PT/blob/main/Windows%20Service%20Exploiter/Screensnips/testservice.png)
5. **`sc create TestService binPath= "C:\Temp\test.exe"`**
6. **`icacls "C:\Temp\test.exe" /grant Everyone:F`** **This command grants full controll to all users which is a potential exploit vector**![](https://github.com/brindhasham/Lab_PT/blob/main/Windows%20Service%20Exploiter/Screensnips/testservice2.png)
7. **The [python service scanner](https://github.com/brindhasham/Lab_PT/blob/main/Windows%20Service%20Exploiter/service_exploiter_windows.py) has to be run with admin privileges using CMD**
8. ****`python`** [service_exploiter_windows.py](https://github.com/brindhasham/Lab_PT/blob/main/Windows%20Service%20Exploiter/service_exploiter_windows.py)**
9. ![](https://github.com/brindhasham/Lab_PT/blob/main/Windows%20Service%20Exploiter/Screensnips/exploitchecker.png) 
10. **The results of the scan is displayed as:** ![](https://github.com/brindhasham/Lab_PT/blob/main/Windows%20Service%20Exploiter/Screensnips/Results.png)
11. **The [service_exploit.log](https://github.com/brindhasham/Lab_PT/blob/main/Windows%20Service%20Exploiter/service_exploit.log) and [vulnerable_services.csv](https://github.com/brindhasham/Lab_PT/blob/main/Windows%20Service%20Exploiter/vulnerable_services.csv) will be saved**
