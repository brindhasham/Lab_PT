PHPSESSID is just the session cookie that PHP apps use to remember who you are… basically DVWA’s little “passport stamp.” It lives in your browser’s cookies.

To find Open DVWA in your browser (example: http://localhost:8080).

Right-click anywhere → Inspect (opens DevTools).

At the top of DevTools, click Application.

On the left sidebar, expand Cookies.

Click the cookie entry for your DVWA URL.

You’ll see a list — look for the row with Name = PHPSESSID.
